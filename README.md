# 🌿 Medical Plant Detection using YOLOv8 and Generative AI

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project focuses on the development of an intelligent and user-friendly web application that can accurately detect **medicinal plants** using deep learning techniques. By leveraging the power of **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once)** object detection model and **Streamlit**, this application allows users to upload images of plants and receive real-time predictions on the identified medicinal species.

This tool is designed to support **botanical research**, **herbal medicine identification**, and **educational purposes**, especially in rural and tribal areas where access to professional botanical expertise may be limited.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a lightweight and accurate object detection model capable of recognizing multiple medicinal plants.
- Deploy an interactive web interface using Streamlit for ease of use.
- Enable image upload, display the most confident plant classification, and provide downloadable reports.
- Maintain user-specific logs with timestamped detection data (name, age, and results).

## 🔍 Model Training & Optimization

- The YOLOv8 model was trained using a **custom dataset** consisting of labeled medicinal plant images.
- Training involves:
  - Data preprocessing and augmentation
  - Bounding box annotations in YOLO format
  - Model fine-tuning and validation
- The final model is exported as `best.pt`, ready for inference.

## 📷 Streamlit Application Features

- 🌱 Upload an image for medicinal plant detection.
- 🔎 Detect and show **only the most confident** plant name from the image.
- 🧾 Display the result clearly below the image.
- 🧑‍💼 Collect user name and age for logging purposes.
- ⏰ Show a **real-time clock** on the interface.
- 📥 Download detection results and image as a `.txt` log file.
- ✨ Custom UI with background styling for an enhanced experience.
